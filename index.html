        <p>My name is <strong>Swaroop</strong>, and I am a passionate and enthusiastic individual currently living in
            Pune.
            I hold a degree
            in business administration and have a strong background in software development, particularly in Java, Unity
            3D,
            C#, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have completed a web development internship, where I honed my
            skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma. Additionally, I have experience in Android development and a
            solid
            understanding of data structures and algorithms.
            <br><br>
            I recently led a team project on an indoor navigation app using augmented reality and AR Core services. I am
            eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills further. I also have experience working with
            databases,
            specifically SQL, and have been involved in various academic projects, including a project on digitalization
            of
            medical records and a travel agency project.
            <br><br>
            In my free time, I enjoy solving coding challenges and enhancing my problem-solving abilities. I pride
            myself on
            being kind, energetic, and logical, and I aim to contribute effectively to any team I am a part of.
